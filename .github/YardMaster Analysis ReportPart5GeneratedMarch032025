# An example hook script to check the commit log message taken by
# applypatch from an e-mail message.
#
# The hook should exit with non-zero status after issuing an
# appropriate message if it wants to stop the commit.  The hook is
# allowed to edit the commit message file.
#
# To enable this hook, rename this file to "applypatch-msg".
