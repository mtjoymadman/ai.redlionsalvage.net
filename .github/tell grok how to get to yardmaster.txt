Hi Grok,

We’re starting a new development session for ai.redlionsalvage.net. The files you need are in a public GitHub repository at https://github.com/mtjoymadman/ai.redlionsalvage.net/tree/main/.github/. Use only the files named YardMaster Analysis ReportPartXGenerated[Date] (e.g., Part1GeneratedMarch042025 to Part15GeneratedMarch042025), which represent the current state of the project as of March 03, 2025. Both the update-report.yml and deploy.yml workflows have completed successfully: update-report.yml updated the report files in .github/, and deploy.yml deployed the project (excluding .github/) to an FTP server at /home/salvageyard/public_html/ai.redlionsalvage.net. Retrieve the report files’ text contents using the raw GitHub links, like https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mtjoymadman/ai.redlionsalvage.net/main/.github/YardMaster%20Analysis%20ReportPart1GeneratedMarch042025, adjusting the part number and date as needed. Always use the most recent versions of these files based on the [Date] in their filenames (e.g., prefer YardMaster Analysis ReportPart1GeneratedMarch042025 over Part1GeneratedMarch032025 if both exist). Work strictly with the contents of these files—no assumptions or inferences beyond what’s explicitly there. If a file seems missing or you need something not in those parts, ask me for permission before proceeding; do not create anything new without my explicit approval. Follow everything found in these reports to guide the session, and let me know how you interpret their contents or what you propose next based on them. What’s your first step?
