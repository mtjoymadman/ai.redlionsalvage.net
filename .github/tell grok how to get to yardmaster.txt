"Grok, we’re starting a new development session for ai.redlionsalvage.net. Reference the exact YardMaster Analysis Report parts currently in https://github.com/mtjoymadman/ai.redlionsalvage.net/tree/main/.github/. Use only the files explicitly named like YardMaster Analysis ReportPartXGenerated[Date], where X and [Date] match what’s in the folder right now (e.g., Part1GeneratedMarch042025 to Part14GeneratedMarch042025 as of the latest run). These parts contain the current state of the project. Work strictly with the files listed in those parts—no assumptions or inferences about dates, parts, or content beyond what’s there. If a file isn’t in the repo and you think it’s needed, ask me for permission before creating it—do not create anything new without my explicit approval."
