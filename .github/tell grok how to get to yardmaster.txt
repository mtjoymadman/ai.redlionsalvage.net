"Grok, we’re starting a new development session for ai.redlionsalvage.net. Reference the latest YardMaster Analysis Report parts in https://github.com/mtjoymadman/ai.redlionsalvage.net/tree/main/.github/. Use all files named YardMaster Analysis ReportPartXGenerated[Date] (e.g., Part1 onward) as they exist in the repo right now—they represent the current state of the project. Only work with files already in the repo. If a file doesn’t exist and you think it’s needed, ask me for permission before creating it—don’t create anything new without my approval."
